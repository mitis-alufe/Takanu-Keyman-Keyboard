# README - Takanu mtk
This keyboard is a modification of a preexisting keyboard made for toki pona's sitelen pona. It was called "sitelen pona (Lentan, UCSUR)" and was made by jan Lepeka.

To install the keyboard, you must open the install and run the the following file:
- takanu_mtk/build/takanu_mtk.kmp
This only works if you have Keyman installed.

I am new to making keyboards, so if it doesn't work, please tell me.
